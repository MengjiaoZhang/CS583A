    "1. Read, complete, and run the code.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Make substantial improvements** to maximize the accurcy.\n",
    "    \n",

    "## Requirements:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. You can use whatever CNN architecture, including VGG, Inception, and ResNet. However, you must build the networks layer by layer. You must NOT import the archetectures from ```keras.applications```.\n",

    "2. Make sure ```BatchNormalization``` is between a ```Conv```/```Dense``` layer and an ```activation``` layer.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. If you want to regularize a ```Conv```/```Dense``` layer, you should place a ```Dropout``` layer **before** the ```Conv```/```Dense``` layer.\n",

    "- Keep in mind that you must download it as an IPYNB file and then use IPython Notebook to convert it to HTML.\n",

    "\n",
    "- In Colab, go to ```Runtime``` --> ```Change runtime type``` --> Do NOT check ```Omit code cell output when saving this notebook```. In this way, the downloaded IPYNB file contains the outputs."
